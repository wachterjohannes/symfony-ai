name: symfony-profiler-debugging
description: Diagnose a Symfony request that failed, errored (5xx), or was slow, using the profiler. Use when a specific request misbehaved and the app has the profiler enabled (usually dev). Not for cross-request trends over time (use log investigation) or DI wiring bugs (use service inspection).

# Profiler debugging

Reads the profiler through Mate's CLI. Two tools, two resources:

- `symfony-profiler-list` filters profiles (`method`, `url`, `ip`, `statusCode`, `context`, `from`, `to`, `limit`). Newest first, so `--limit=1` is the latest. Returns summaries with a `resource_uri` per profile.
- `symfony-profiler-get --token=<t>` returns one profile's metadata. It does NOT list collectors.
- `symfony-profiler-compare --baseline=<t1> --current=<t2> [--collector=db]` diffs the `summary` of one collector across two profiles.
- `symfony-profiler://profile/{token}` lists the collectors this profile actually has, each with its URI.
- `symfony-profiler://profile/{token}/{collector}` returns that collector, as `{name, data, summary}`. `summary` is the triage view, `data` the full detail.

Every command accepts `--format`: `json` to parse the result, `toon` (when `helgesverre/toon` is installed) for the smallest context footprint. On a large profile, prefer one of these over the human-readable default.

## Workflow

1. Find the profile. Do not scroll all profiles.
   - Error: `mate tools:call symfony-profiler-list --statusCode=500 --limit=5`
   - Known URL: `--url=/checkout`. Latest request: `--limit=1`.
2. `mate resources:read symfony-profiler://profile/<token>` to see which collectors exist. Apps differ; only read what is present.
3. Read collectors in diagnosis order, not all of them.
4. When the profile does not account for the symptom, continue in the logs — do not stop at the profile boundary. Trigger cases: `has_exception` is false on a 5xx, `logger` reports errors or warnings the collectors do not otherwise explain, or the work that failed happened in a different request (queue worker, sub-request, earlier write). Carry the identifier over:
   - `mate tools:call monolog-search --term="<message from the logger collector>" --level=error`
   - `mate tools:call monolog-context-search --key=request_id --value=<id from the logger context>`

   The profiler sees exactly one request. The logs see every request, including the one that swallowed the exception. Follow the skill for log investigation from there and come back with what it names.

## Reading order

Branch on the symptom.

**Errored (5xx / exception):** read `exception` first.
`data.class`, `message` (secrets scrubbed), `file`, `line`, and `trace` (top 10 frames) are the fix. If `has_exception` is false on an error response, the failure is upstream and this profile will not name it: check `request` for the status and `logger` for what was logged, then go to workflow step 4 and follow it into the logs. A swallowed exception leaves a log line even when it leaves no collector entry.

**Slow but succeeded:** skip `exception`, go to `time`, then `db`, then `memory`.
- `time`: `duration_ms` is total. `events` are sorted slowest first with a `category` (e.g. `doctrine`, `template`, `controller`) that tells you which subsystem ate the time. That category picks the next collector.
- `db`: `query_count` plus `summary.duplicate_query_count`. `queries` are grouped by identical SQL, sorted by `total_time_ms`. An N+1 shows as one grouped entry with a high `count` (same statement fired in a loop), or a high `duplicate_query_count`. One slow statement shows as a high `avg_time_ms`. `sample_params` shows what was bound. Grouped list caps at 50 (`queries_truncated`).
- `memory`: `usage_percent` against the limit. Only relevant when the request is heavy or OOMs.

**Wrong output / bad input:** read `request`.
`summary` has `method`, `path`, `route`, `status_code`, `content_type`. `data` has the sanitized bags (`request_query`, `request_request`, `request_headers`, `session_attributes`). Sensitive values, the raw body, and the curl command are redacted or omitted by design, so do not expect to read a password back.

**Tie a log line to the request:** `logger` has `error_count` / `warning_count` / `deprecation_count` and the per-request `logs` (message, level, `channel`, context; capped at 100). Use it to see what the code logged during exactly this request, which the global log files cannot pin to one request.

A non-zero `error_count` or `warning_count` with no matching exception is the handoff signal: this request logged something the collectors do not explain. Take the message or a context key from `logs` into `monolog-search` / `monolog-context-search` (workflow step 4) to find out whether it is a one-off or has been happening all week.

Other collectors present in the profile (router, security, twig, ...) are readable at the same URI shape; they return raw dumps rather than a curated shape.

## Prove the fix

A performance fix is not done when the page still renders. It is done when the number moved.
Keep the token you diagnosed on, then after the change reproduce the same request, take the new
token from `symfony-profiler-list --limit=1`, and compare:

```
mate tools:call symfony-profiler-compare --baseline=<old> --current=<new> --collector=db
```

It returns both summaries, a `delta` per numeric metric, and a `verdict` (`improved`,
`unchanged`, `regressed`). Report the delta, not the impression. `--collector=time` or
`memory` works the same way for whatever metric the symptom was about. `unchanged` after a
fix means the fix did not hit the hot path — go back to the reading order.

## Failure paths

- `symfony-profiler-list` returns no profiles: the profiler is off (not enabled, or prod), or nothing has been requested since it was cleared. Fall back to log investigation.
- `symfony-profiler-get` on a stale/wrong token errors with "Profile ... not found". Re-list to get a live token; tokens change when the profiler storage is cleared.
- A collector URI returns `{"error": ...}` instead of data: that collector is not in this profile, or the name is wrong. Re-read `symfony-profiler://profile/{token}` for the real names.
- The failing request was a sub-request: the profile has a `parent_token` / `parent_profile`. The real exception often sits on the parent, not the fragment.
